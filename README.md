üöÄ Getting Started
	1.	Clone / Download the repo and open the builder:

git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
# Open in your browser (any static server or just double-click the HTML file)
# macOS:
open nav_builder.html
# or serve:
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then visit http://localhost:8080/nav_builder.html


	2.	Build a menu
	‚Ä¢	Click + Add root item to add a top-level entry.
	‚Ä¢	Use the ‚â° handle to drag for reordering or nesting.
	‚Ä¢	Ôºã adds a child to the current item.
	‚Ä¢	Click the twirl ‚ñæ to collapse/expand; Alt/Option+click twirls the whole branch.
	3.	Preview & polish
	‚Ä¢	Hover items with a caret to reveal children.
	‚Ä¢	Choose a Global animation (Underline, Rise, Pulse, None) or override per-item.

üì• Importing

Import JSON
	‚Ä¢	Accepts nested arrays (children) or flat arrays (with parentId).
	‚Ä¢	Options:
	‚Ä¢	Promote to root ‚Äî lift imported items to top level (no wrapper).
	‚Ä¢	Replace current ‚Äî overwrite the current tree.

Import HTML (Deep)

Paste or upload existing site nav markup. The importer detects:
	‚Ä¢	<ul><li><a> structures
	‚Ä¢	Mega-menu patterns (e.g., .dropdown-container, .main-menu-list, etc.)
	‚Ä¢	Label extraction from .main-menu-link__name (ignores counters like .text--meta)
	‚Ä¢	Optional: Auto-nest by URL path if the markup is flat.

Tip: If a specific site uses unique wrappers/classes, you can extend the selector list in the importer.

‚∏ª

üì§ Exporting

JSON

A clean structural representation of your menu.

HTML + CSS

A standalone, multi-level dropdown nav (carets, hover interactions, animations).
Good for quickly embedding into static sites or prototypes.

Gainsight Customer Community (CC)

Exports window.customMegaMenuItems objects:
	‚Ä¢	Each root with children becomes a CC dropdown item:
	‚Ä¢	key: "custom-dropdown" (required by CC)
	‚Ä¢	position from your root item (or auto-numbered)
	‚Ä¢	roles from the item‚Äôs Roles field (array)
	‚Ä¢	Roots without children are omitted (prevents empty carets/blank dropdowns).
	‚Ä¢	Children map to CC items; a child with children and no href is exported as isContainer: true.

‚∏ª

‚å®Ô∏è Shortcuts
	‚Ä¢	Undo: Ctrl/Cmd + Z
	‚Ä¢	Redo: Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z
	‚Ä¢	Collapse/expand subtree: Alt/Option + click the twirl ‚ñæ/‚ñ∏

‚∏ª

üß© UI Tips
	‚Ä¢	Transparent backgrounds: the editor stores empty bg as ‚Äútransparent‚Äù; the preview respects it, and the color input stays valid (no transparent in <input type="color">).
	‚Ä¢	Resizable editor: Drag the vertical divider between the editor and preview. Double-click the divider to reset. Size persists in localStorage.

‚∏ª

üß™ Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	Labels show a trailing ‚Äú0‚Äù
Your source HTML likely includes counters like <span class="text--meta">0</span>.
The importer strips those on import via .main-menu-link__name detection.
	‚Ä¢	Divider looks off / doesn‚Äôt resize correctly
Ensure there is only one <div class="layout"> wrapper containing exactly three direct children:
	1.	left panel, 2) <div id="divider">, 3) right panel.
	‚Ä¢	Nothing imports from HTML
Verify your markup contains a <nav> or a <ul> with <li><a> links.
If it‚Äôs highly custom, share a small snippet and extend the selectors in the importer.

‚∏ª

üó∫ Roadmap
	‚Ä¢	Import from Gainsight CC API (token-based), with a local proxy to avoid CORS.
	‚Ä¢	One-click ‚ÄúGroups‚Äù dropdown builder from API data.
	‚Ä¢	Collapse/Expand All toolbar actions.
	‚Ä¢	Custom theming presets for the HTML/CSS export.
